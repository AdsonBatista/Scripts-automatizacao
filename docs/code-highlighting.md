MaterialDocs supports code highlighting with [syntax.css](https://github.com/mojombo/tpw/blob/master/css/syntax.css) and Rouge or Pygments.  Follow the [Jekyll guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting) for setting up highlighting.

Example JavaScript snippet:

```javascript
function pi(){
  // Calculate Pi
  var pi = 22/7
  return pi
}
```
